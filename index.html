    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <h2>Understanding India: </h2>
    <p>Here’s an astonishing fact – India has the highest number of women pilots at 12.4% of total pilots (one in every eight pilots is a woman), but simultaneously also one of the lowest female labour participation rate!.
        While we all think of India as a billion-large population, much of the heavy lifting on consumption is by a slim class of consumers, about 10-12% of the population, though still sizeable at ~100m.
    </p>
    <h2>The India Consumer Stack</h2>
    <p>India which is country of 1.3 billion people and GDP
        over $3 trillion dollars but in terms of distribution of
        resources and diffrence between rich and poor is staggering.
        you can see that in this numbers
    </p>
    <h2>India 1</h2>
    <p>India 1 is the category which includes top 110 million people
        and this class of people drives around 40% of india's GDP around
        $1 trillion.Large ammount of that portion lives in metro cities of
        tier 2 cities.Their values and the social class are similar to
        western Culture.
    </p>
    <h2>India 2</h2>
    <p>India 2 have population around 95 million and it drives $230 billion
        GDP.Most probably they are the pople who has just crossed line of India 3.
        they are the class which repects the formal education most.
    </p>
    <h2>India 3</h2>
    <p>India 3 have population of more than 1 billion people who drives
        more than $1 trillion worth of GDP.most of them are self employed or
        working in privet sector or labour work.
    </p>
    <h2>Interpretation</h2>
    <p>Large sum of india is not aware of this class system of population except the people of India 1
        and they are the ones who controlls the distribution of wealth in other classes.
        most of them thinks that saas,fintech and retail is really hard to built up while targeting
        the people of india 2 and india 3 coz they dont have enough servicing ammount to pay for
        product.
    </p>
    <p>In most of the cases its true like fintech and saas most probably not gonna
        work in those class but the retail,retail can be whole diffrent story while targeting
        those audience.remember the class 1 indias yeah they can pay for every
        service they like and they don't mind for paying to save their time.they
        pays for services and non physical products but how much of thier income they gonna
        spend on goods and services 30% or 40% maximum coz they are earning more
        than they need.This class is educated they know about finances large ammount
        their income is going to be invested in assets.that's really clear
        that's why fintech startup users are class 1 people.
    </p>
    <p>India 3 is just earning enough to get food and essential services
        they hesitates buying non physical goods but in most of the cases every
        single penny which is earned is gonna spent.im tired by writing im gonna
        end this thing and that much people need goods and those goods are gonna
        benefit in retail and really high transection increase in basics.  </p>
