    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <h2>Understanding India: </h2>
    <p>Here’s an astonishing fact – India has the highest number of women pilots at 12.4% of total pilots (one in every eight pilots is a woman), but simultaneously also one of the lowest female labour participation rate!.
        While we all think of India as a billion-large population, much of the heavy lifting on consumption is by a slim class of consumers, about 10-12% of the population, though still sizeable at ~100m.
